## Ticket Filtering and Sorting

The ticketing system includes robust filtering and sorting functionality to improve workflow efficiency:

- **Filter Options**:
  - **New Tickets**: View tickets that have just been submitted and require review.
  - **Open Tickets**: View tickets that are actively being worked on.
  - **Working Tickets**: See tickets currently in progress.
  - **Closed Tickets**: Quickly find tickets that have been resolved.

- **Sorting Options**:
  - Sort tickets by **urgency level** to address the most critical issues first.
  - Sort by **creation date** to prioritize older tickets that need attention.

---

## Challenges Faced

- **Dependency Management**: Resolving conflicts between updated versions of libraries and ensuring compatibility.
- **Role-Based Views**: Implementing access control to differentiate between regular users, tech support, and admins. Each role required different permissions and UI views.
- **Filtering and Sorting Logic**: Designing an intuitive system for filtering and sorting tickets required thoughtful planning and testing.
- **Scalability**: Ensuring that the application can handle a large number of tickets and users without performance degradation.

---

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Search and Filter Options**:
   - Add advanced search functionality to find tickets by keywords, usernames, or tags.

2. **Email Notifications**:
   - Notify users via email when their ticket status changes or when a reply is added.

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**:
   - Optimize the interface for mobile devices to ensure usability across all platforms.

4. **Dashboard Analytics**:
   - Provide admins and tech support with statistics on ticket volume, average resolution time, most common issues, etc.

5. **Integration with External Tools**:
   - Allow ticket export to tools like Excel or integration with third-party project management systems.
